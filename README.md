# Online Retail Analysis with SQL and Tableau
Online Retail Exploratory SQL Project using PostgreSQL with the use of Tableau for visualizing findings

# Project Description
Explore a public transnational data set of 1 CSV file containing all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.


## Methodology
Explore and analyze the data set using the tools that I have been learning and using at work:
- Excel for skimming and improving the efficiency of cleaning data
- PostgreSQL for cleaning and analyzing data
- Tableau for visualizing findings


## Primary Objective
1. Clean data by:
* Checking the formats and raw data of all columns
* Removing duplications and unused data
* Creating views for analyzing data


2. Check data contribution by country.


3. Check abnormal invoices and non-transactional invoices for additional findings.


4. Analyze sales metrics:
* Top 10 countries by total sales
* Country with the highest sales by a single invoice in UK
* Sales over a time period (by month, by quarter)
* Basket size
* Average order value

5. Analyze customer metrics
* Customer retention rate by month
* RFM
* Customer lifetime value
* Customer segmentation


6. Export tables as csv files.


7. Import SQL tables into Tableau to visualize findings.


## Bonus Objective
1. Try using Tableau to visualize cohort charts

2. Look for additional findings using Tableau visualizations
